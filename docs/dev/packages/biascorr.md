# i7aof.biascorr

Purpose: Bias-correction methods (time-slice, projection) to align CMIP outputs with observational climatologies.

- Key modules: `timeslice`, `projection`
- Responsibilities: compute climatologies, apply corrections, manage masks/extrapolation order.
- Inputs: CMIP fields, observational climatologies, grid/mask metadata.
- Outputs: bias-corrected fields on ISMIP grids.

TBD: Algorithms, configuration options, and worked examples.
