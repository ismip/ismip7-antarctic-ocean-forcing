## About

`i7aof` aims to provide a reproducible toolkit to:

- download and remap CMIP output and other inputs to ISMIP grids;
- compute annual means from monthly data;
- extrapolate fields across shelves, cavities, ice, and bathymetry;
- perform bias correction using observational climatologies;
- provide helper scripts for MeltMIP-style experiments.

This project is under active development; interfaces may change.
